# Image Classification of Nature Scenes

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for classifying images of nature scenes using CNN model. The project focuses on preprocessing image data, training the model, and evaluating their performance.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust image classification system capable of identifying different types of nature scenes from a given dataset of images.

## Project Structure
The project includes loading the image dataset, preprocessing steps including resizing images, normalization, and data augmentation, training a CNN model for classification, and then performing evaluation for the model with appropriate metrics.
